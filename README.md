## 📁 What is this?

**filing-cabinet** is my digital junk drawer — a place to store all the random stuff I build while learning.

Expect a mix of:
- 💡 Codecademy projects
- 🧪 Code experiments and small builds
- 🔧 Incomplete side quests
- 🎨 Just-for-fun creations

## 🧭 Why it exists

Because:
- I need to determine where in this swamp squatteth the toad of truth
- My Downloads folder needs a break
- I cannot install programs properly
- Version control is magical ✨

## ⚙️ Tech Stack (varies)

> Whatever the tutorial told me to use...
